1. YOLO Object Detection (yolo_detector.cpp)
This project implements real-time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models with OpenCV’s deep learning module. It supports detection in images, videos, and live camera feeds, with configurable parameters for different YOLO versions and hardware acceleration options (CPU/GPU).

2. Face Detection with OpenCV (face_detection.cpp)
This code utilizes OpenCV’s Haar Cascades and Deep Learning-based models for real-time face detection. It can process images, videos, and webcam feeds to detect human faces efficiently, with optional tuning for performance optimization.

3. Edge Detection using Canny Algorithm (canny_edge.cpp)
This implementation applies the Canny Edge Detection algorithm in OpenCV to detect edges in images and videos. It enhances visual structure extraction by detecting strong edges while reducing noise, making it useful for preprocessing tasks in computer vision applications.
